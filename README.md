The starting input for the project were six CSV files. Their column headers and relationships are diagrammed in the ERD shown above. Once relationships were mapped, databases were created, linked through keys, and the data from the CSVs were imported. Once this was done were were able to begin making queries and isolating useful chunks of information. These query results were then, in turn, exported into their own discrete CSV files for later review.

Early stage inquiries involved collecting lists of PH employees who where were "of retirement age," department managers, and potential retirees from select departments. The end of project Challenge section focused on creating two primary query results:
- a summary of the number of retiring employees by their current job title;
- a list of all employees eligible for a mentorship program designed for retiring staff.
